# C - Hello, World

In this project, I learned about compilation using `gcc`, how to using `main` function.

### All Tasks Here :

+ Preprocessor
  - [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor): Bash script that runs a C file saved in      the variable `$CFILE` through the preprocessor and saves the result in the file c.
  
+ Compiler
  - [1-compiler](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler): Bash script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` that does not link, saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.o`extension.
     - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the output is `main.o`.
     
+ Assembler
  - [2-assembler](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler): Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code saved in the variable `$CFILE`, saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a     `.s` extension.
     - Example: If the C file is `main.c`, the result is `main.s`.
     
+ Name
  - [3-name](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name): Bash Script that compiles a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE` and creates an executable cisfun.
    
+ Hello, puts
  - [4-puts.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c): C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the function `puts`.
  
+ Hello, printf
 - [5-printf.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c): C program that prints exactly `with proper grammer, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line, using the function `printf`.
 
+ Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
  - [6-size.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c): C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
 
+ Intel
  - [100-intel](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel): Script that generates the assembly code in Intel syntax of a C file saved in the variable `$CFILE`, saves the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.s` extension.
