# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm, In these projects, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

+ [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world)
+ [0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
