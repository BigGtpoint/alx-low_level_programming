# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C. Additionally, how to declaring and defining variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, and learned how to use `if` and `if...else` statements, and implementing `while loop`.

All Tasks Here

+ 0.  Positive anything is better than negative nothing
  - [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) :C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line:
    - Completion of this source [code.](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c)
    - The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program.
    - The output of the program should be:
      - The number, followed by
        - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
        - if the number is 0: `is zero`
        - if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
      - followed by a new line.

  
+ 1.  The last digit
  - [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/BigGtpoint/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) :C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number, followed by a new line:
    - Compilation of this source [code.](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c)
    - The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program.
    - The output of the program should be:
      - The string `Last digit of`, followed by
      - `n`, followed by
      - the string `is`, followed by
        - if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string and `is greater than 5`.
        - if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string and `is zero`
        - if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string and `is less than 6 and not 0`
      - followed by a new line
